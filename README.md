# Audio Downloader

A self-hosted web application for downloading songs, albums, or playlists from Spotify and YouTube as MP3 files. The application provides a web interface for users to input links, which are then downloaded as audio files using `spotdl` (for Spotify) or `yt-dlp` (for YouTube).

This is a fork, please read carefully the modifications

# Informations about this fork

This version is in french, you will not understand the content, unless you speak french...?

**If you plan on using it, just fork this fork, and modify to modify, it's better to be better. ü§ì**

## üëÆüèº CAREFUL Security issues (thbo)

As for my mommy issues, I also have security issues. If you plan on using this version, it is made without the login. Be sure to use this only in local environnement.

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª API Usage (thbo)

This API is basic, I just removed the need of the cookie, so you can just fetch the url
`http://yourip:5005/download?spotify_link={thelink}`
and the download will start. Easier to prevent cookie expiration, without cookies. ü§°

## üõú Web (thbo)

The web panel doesn't need any login. So be careful when opening public access.

## üóÉÔ∏è Download Folder (thbo)

As asked for a friend, I removed the folders, it just downloads the file like this: `{SongNum} - {Artist} - {Title}.mp3`
